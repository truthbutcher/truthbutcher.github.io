# Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Tianjian Li. I have received my B.A. in Mathematics and Computer Science from New York University. I will be pursuing a M.S. degree at Johns Hopkins University starting from fall 2022.

My current research interests span natural language processing and deep learning. Currently focusing on NLP under multilingual settings, I aim to design more resource efficient algorithms for 1) Improving the ability for smaller models to perform zero-shot/few-shot transfer learning tasks; 2) Enhancing the performance of large multilingual language models on low resource languages.

I am also interested in more broader topics in NLP that may or may not be about deep learning, which includes but not limited to semantic parsing, POS tagging, CF grammar, and phase alignment.

There is a list of wonderful CS courses for self studying as well as my study notes under this repository, which I will try to update regularly.

I enjoy watching old movies as well as spending time with the nature during my spare time. If you have anything to share with me, please feel free to contact me through my email: tli104@jhu.edu

My [CV](https://truthbutcher.github.io/assets/CV.pdf) is here.
